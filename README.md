# Challenge-3-The-Physics-of-Alpine-Skiing

![alt text](./swisski.png)

#### Speed and Forces during alpine skiing


Data:		
Trajectory data athletes


Idea: 		
From GPS Tracking data several physical metrics such as acceleration, speed, and the forces at play should be visually presented in a way that the coach can analyze it.

Goal:		
Advanced speed and force visualization

Technology:
streamlit.io and or others

Data Source:	
-	Goal is at the end to connect the analysis directly to the API
-	Goal is at the end to deploy the analysis into My Swiss-Ski framework (Could be integrated right away)
-	Source 1 (to send): .csv from 4 athletes and multiple runs
-	Source 2 (to send): .csv from the calculated values of the above mentioned runs
-	Source 3 (to send): .py code where force calculation has already been made.
